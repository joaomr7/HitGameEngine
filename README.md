# Hit Game Engine

![HIT](assets/images/HIT_logo.png)

Hit Game Engine is an attempt to make a cross-platform, fast, simple, intuitive, safe and open-source game engine.

## Getting Started
For building, Visual Studio 2022 is recommended(it's what I'm using). To download the repository, just run `git clone --recursive https://github.com/joaomr7/HitGameEngine` in your machine.

Also, to build vulkan renderer, you need to have installed the Vulkan SDK.

## Plan

At a first moment, the main goal is to make a complete 2D and 3D renderer with c++ scripting. 

Some limitations in this stage are going to be:

* Just Windows support
* Just Vulkan rendering api
* Lack of documentation

For a complete list of upcoming features look `EngineFeatures.md`
